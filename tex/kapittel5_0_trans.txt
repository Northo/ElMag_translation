[2.19] {Power on a leader [2.20]}
[2.21]
An electron with charge [2.22] moving at a speed [2.23] in a conductor located in a magnetic field [2.24] will be affected by a force according to the Lorentz force
[1.1]
[2.25]
 The total force on a live conductor in a magnetic field becomes the resulting force on all the electrons in the conductor:
[1.2]
[2.26]
where [2.27] is the length of the conductor, [2.28] is the cross-sectional area, [2.29] is the electron density and consequently [2.30] is equal to the total number of electrons in the conductor. The speed [2.31] must be understood as the average speed (operating speed) of the electrons.
The electric current in a conductor is defined as
[1.3]
and consequently the power can be expressed
[1.4]
[2.32]
where [2.33] must be perceived as a vector with direction along the conductor in the current direction. Printed in scalar form, the equation is
[1.5]
where [2.34] is the angle between the magnetic field and the positive current direction in the conductor. When the conduction direction is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction is [2.35], and equation [2.36] is simplified to
[1.6]
[2.37]
The force on a live conductor in a magnetic field can be measured with the arrangement in figure [2.38].
[1.7]
The magnet rests on the scale, while the live conductor is fixed independently of the scale. The force effect between the conductor and the magnet will be registered as a result of the weight. However, the weight is calibrated and graded to measure mass [2.39] in grams as a certain value for gravitational acceleration [2.40] is assumed. As is well known, the connection between power and mass is given by
[1.8]
so that from equation [2.41] we will express the weighting result:

[2.64]

You replace the conductor with a coil as shown in figure [2.65] where the angle between the coil axis and the magnetic field direction is variable. The coil has [2.66] rectangular windings with side lengths [2.67] and only the lower part of the coil lies in the magnetic field so that the force only acts on the lower horizontal part of the windings, ie [2.68] total length [2.69]. The angle between the current direction and the magnetic field is [2.70] and is included in the equation for calculating the force.

The scale is a precision instrument that you must handle with care. Take special care to avoid shocks to the weighing pan during assembly and disassembly of the stand. The scale is based on an electromagnetic weighing method according to the compensation principle so that the weighing pan does not change position during weighing. This is important for our measurements.

[2,145]

The conductors used in the experiments are built up as modern electronic circuit boards with narrow current paths of copper steamed on fiberglass-reinforced polyester sheets. To prevent oxidation of the copper surface, it is covered with tin. In total, the instrument set-up contains six fixed current paths of different lengths, of which four are single and two are double.

As a magnetic field source, a magnetic well built up of six identical permanent magnets is used. The field in the well can be varied by removing the magnets one by one.

To investigate the power sfa. the angle between field direction and current direction is used in the last experiment a rotatable coil with its own magnetic well.

[2,147]

Task: [2,148] [2,149]

Suggested procedure:
[2,150]
[2,151]
[2,152]
    [2.153] Select one of the current paths and measure the length [2.154] and the width [2.155] of the current path with calipers. (Be careful not to damage the current path with the caliper.) Preliminarily define the length of the current [2.156] path as the outer dimension in the longitudinal direction. [2,157]
    Later you will have the opportunity to reconsider this definition.
     
    [2.158] Prepare the power supply: Check that it is switched off and the current and voltage are set to 0.
    [2.159] use the multimeter to measure the current
    [2.160] Connect the circuit as shown in figure [2.161]. .
    [2.162] Check the weight level (back level, adjust feet) and then turn on the weight.
    [2.163] Place the magnetic well in the middle of the scale with the perforated cylinder between the magnetic well and the scale. [2,164]
    (The perforated cylinder is inserted to increase the distance between the magnetic well and the weight to avoid the magnetic field from the magnetic well interfering with the weight.)
    [2.165] Adjust the position of the conductor relative to the magnetic well so that it is in the center of the magnetic field.
    [2,166]
    [2,167] Reset the weight.
    NOTE: To be absolutely sure that no current is flowing in the circuit during the reset, disconnect the circuit by unplugging one of the connectors while resetting.
    [2,168]
    
The measurement can now be started. The power supply must be power-controlled, but the power supply can deliver up to [2,169] while [2,170]}. It is your responsibility to make sure that the power line is not overloaded! Keep an eye on the electricity meter!

the measurement should provide answers to the following:
[2,171]
        [2.172] What is the relationship between the weight [2.173] sfa. the current [2,174] in the range 0- [2,175]? Document the measurement results in the lab journal and in a data file.
        [2,176]
        [2.177] What happens when you change the polarity of the current path? Do you get an expected result?
    [2.178] What happens when you turn the magnet? Do you get an expected result?
    [2.179] Show in a sketch current directions and force directions and identify the magnetic poles.
    [2,180]
    [2,181]
    [2,182]
     [2,183]
    [2,184]
    [2.185] Finally measure the magnetic field [2.186] in the magnetic well with the Gauss meter.

     [2,202]
    [2.203] Is the value of [2.204] equal to the slope number [2.205] from the experimental curve within the uncertainty? If not, can you explain the discrepancy?
    [2.206] Plot the deviation between measured values ​​and values ​​from linear regression for the force as a function of current. Does it look like there is a linear relationship between power and current? (Hint: Look at how the measurement points are distributed around the regression line.) If you assume that there is a linear relationship, does the size of the deviations correspond to the measurement accuracy of the weight? [2.207]
    [2.208] Can you, when you take into account the results of the error analysis, claim that you have verified equation [2.209]?
