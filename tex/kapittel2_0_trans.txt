[2.14] {Theoretical background}
[2.15]

Here the theory is presented very briefly. Some theory is also reviewed in the text of the calculation tasks in section [2.16]. Otherwise, reference is made to the textbook and the lectures in electricity and magnetism.

[2.17]
[2.18] {Coulomb's Law}
[2.19]

The electrostatic force (Coulomb force) [2.20] between two point charges [2.21] and [2.22] at a distance [2.23] in empty space is given by Coulomb's law:
[1.1]
where [2.24] is the void permittivity.

[2.25]
[2.26] {Force Sensors}
[2.27]
[2.28]

Coulomb used a torsion scale in his experiment in 1785 [2.29] {The operation of a torsion scale was thoroughly reviewed in the experiment for determining the gravitational constant in the lab course in Mechanical Physics, and we therefore refer to the lab booklet in Mechanical Physics for a detailed description and operation.} measure the electrostatic force between two charged metal spheres and thus establish the inverse square ratio of force to distance. It is common to represent deviations from the inverse square law by expressing the distance dependence as [2.30]. Coulomb's value for [2.31] is [2.32]. There have been many attempts to find a more precise value. In 1971, Williams, Faller, and Hill [2.33] {[2.34] [2.35], 721 (1971)} examined the validity of Coulomb's law in the most accurate "macroscopic" experiment to date. Given the distance dependence on the shape [2.36], they found that [2.37].

In the experiment, use a force sensor to repeat Coulomb's experiment. Since the power sensor provides a direct measurement value, it is important for us to have an understanding of how this works, and why it states the measurement figures it makes.


[2.38]
[2.39] {Stretch flap} [2.40]
[2.41]
The ohmic resistance of a material of length [2.42] and a cross-sectional area [2.43] is given by
[1.2]
where [2.44] is the specific resistance of the material. This can be used to make a tensile sensor, which increases the resistance if the length of a conductor is increased and reduces the resistance correspondingly if the conductor is compressed. The cross-sectional area also decreases somewhat with elongation and increases somewhat with compression. This will, seen from equation [2.45], be an advantage as we want the largest possible measurable change in the resistance.

A strain gauge sensor is a conductor laid on an elastic foil in such a way that a change in one dimension can be easily detected, while a change in the other dimensions does not significantly affect the sensor. A typical stretch flap is shown in Figure [2.46]. Which direction is the sensitive direction for measurements and why?

[2.47]
[2.48] {Wheatsones bro} [2.49]
[2.50]
Wheatstone's bridge, which basically consists of two voltage dividers [2.51] {See chapter [2.52] for a repetition / introduction of what a voltage divider is.}, Is a classic and effective way to find the value of an unknown opponent. The bridge consists of a known voltage source, four resistors, and a sensitive measuring instrument (galvanometer or multimeter). Traditionally, such a setup was used to measure the magnitude of an unknown resistor by letting it enter the bridge together with a known resistor and with an accurately variable resistor (sliding resistor) connected for one voltage divider.
In Figure [2.53], typically [2.54] and [2.55] would be the shear resistance, [2.56] would have known value, and [2.57] would be the unknown resistance. You set the sliding resistance and find when the measuring instrument does not show any deflection. The ratio between the known and unknown resistors is then given by the ratio of the sliding resistor, and one can then calculate the value of the unknown resistor.


[1.4]


[2.58]
[2.59] {Force Sensors} [2.60]
[2.61]
In the power sensor itself, the Wheatstone bridge is used a little differently than explained above. Instead of varying the resistances of the output voltage [2.62], only the voltage is read as a measure of how different the resistances are. Four tension flaps are used on a adapted body, positioned so that two are compressed and two are stretched. Figure [2.63] shows a cross section of the force sensor that we use in our experiment. The four tension flaps are identical when the sensor has no load and has a value of [2.64], when they are subjected to a load (either tension or compression) we denote the change [2.65].

From equation [2.66] we see that a change in resistance in a tensile flap is proportional to a change in its length [2.67] {The cross section of the conductor in the tensile flap does not change significantly.}. Furthermore, we can assume that Hooke's law applies to the material in the sensor, ie that a change in length is proportional to the force applied. This means that the change in resistance [2.68] is proportional to the force. It can be shown that the output voltage, [2.69], is proportional to the change in resistance, [2.70], and thus we see that the output voltage of the force sensor is linearly dependent on the force it is to measure [2.71] {The relationship between output voltage, [2.72], and change in resistance, [2.73], is given in equation [2.74]. You will arrive at this connection yourself in one of the pre-assignments in chapter [2.75].}.

The power sensor is connected to a `` universal display unit '' which converts the output signal to power measured in [2.76]. We cannot change this conversion, the calibration, but it should be checked. The unit has a reset button marked [2.77], by pressing this the unit uses the current value of the output voltage, [2.78], as the zero reference point for further calculation of power. The power sensor and the electronics of the display unit require a certain warm-up time before it stabilizes. Therefore, be sure to turn on the unit for at least half an hour before taking the actual measuring series to avoid operation. The overall setup for the experiment is shown in Figure [2.79].

A typical resting resistance (the resistance without load) for a tensile flap is [2.93].


[2.94] {Metal ball in empty space}

The ability of an electrode to pick up charge depends, among other things, on of the capacitance of the electrode defined by
[1.8]
where [2.95] the charge of the electrode and [2.96] the potential (voltage) of the electrode are relatively infinite. For a metal [2.97] sphere with a radius [2.98], we can calculate from Gauss's law that the capacitance in empty space is
[1.9]
[2.99]
In the experiment, use spherical electrodes with radius [2,100].

[2,105]

[2.106] {Determination of charge using. Faradaybur [2,107]}
[2,108]

According to Coulomb's law [2,109], there is a repulsive force between equal electric charges. Charges on an electrode will therefore seek as far away from each other as possible and consequently be distributed evenly over the outer surface of the electrode. Inside the electrode it will then be both charge-free and field-free. This was proved by Faraday.
[1.10]
 
[1.11]
Faraday electrically insulated a metal bucket and connected an electroscope to the outside of the bucket. Then he lowered a loaded metal ball, where the ball was fastened in a silk thread (which is a good insulator), into the bucket. As the ball came in contact with the bottom, the electroscope showed that the bucket changed state from uncharged to charged. The electroscope also showed results before the ball was in physical contact with the bucket, and when the ball was taken up by the bucket, examinations showed that it was uncharged. Faraday interpreted this so that when the bullet touches the bottom of the bucket and becomes part of it, electrically speaking, the charges (which were originally placed on the outside of the bullet) will move to the outside of the bucket.

We can use Faraday's setup to measure the charge on a charged electrode: The Faraday cage is shown in Figure [2.110] and the setup is shown in Figure [2.111]. The electrode with the charge to be measured is immersed in the hollow electrode, the so-called Faraday cage, which is well isolated from earth and corresponds to the bucket in Faraday's experiment. Instead of an electroscope, we use an electrometer to measure the voltage [2.112] of the Faraday cage relative to the earth.


The Faraday cage, the wires of the electrometer and the electrometer itself can be considered as an electrode configuration that has a certain constant capacitance [2.113] to ground. If this capacitance is known (or it can be measured), the charge can be calculated from [2.114].

Assume that [2.115] and that a voltage [2.116] is measured when a particular charged electrode is lowered into the Faraday cage.

{[2.117] 3. Calculate the charge [2.118] on the electrode.}
[2,119]

The Faraday cage itself is isolated from earth, but surrounded by a grounded mesh cylinder that shields against electromagnetic noise. A coaxial cable (see Figures [2,120] and [2,121])

[1.12]
is connected to the electrometer. This cable has two terminals, of which the center conductor is connected to the Faraday cage and the shield wire to the surrounding mesh cylinder. This is outlined in Figure [2.122]. In addition, a ground wire is connected from the ground point of the electrometer to the ground shield. The electrometer measures the voltage between the input terminals by connecting the voltage across a known, large resistance [2.123] between the input terminals, and measuring the current [2.124] in the resistor. From Ohm's law, the voltage [2,125] is calculated, and the scale of the electrometer shows the voltage [2,126] directly.

[1.13]

The charge supplied to the electrometer for measurement will thus leak to earth through [2.127]. The resistance [2.128] must therefore be selected large, otherwise the charge will disappear before you can measure it. It can also not be selected too large, as the current [2,129] becomes too small to be measured accurately.

Assume that [2,130], [2,131] and [2,132] are as calculated above.

{[2.133] 4. Estimate how much of the charge leaks to earth through the electrometer in five minutes.}
Catalog [2,134] [2,135]

Catalog [2,140] [2,141] [2,142]
The electrometer can measure voltages up to a maximum [2.143]. Significantly higher voltages will damage the electrometer. Since the input resistance is as large as [2,144], this means. that input currents significantly greater than [2,145] will damage the electrometer.

Your body and clothes are easily charged up to several thousand volts e.g. during a brisk march along the corridor. If you are charged and touch the input terminals of the electrometer, there is a high probability that you will exceed both the current and voltage limits of the electrometer and damage the input circuit. Before you start working with the electrometer, it is therefore important that you discharge your body. What you do [2.146] During the measurements, keep yourself discharged by letting one hand be in contact with the screen plate as much as possible.

The connection to the electrometer is through a so-called BNC connector. This connector is specially made for use with so-called coaxial cables. Coaxial cables are two conductors where one conductor forms a cylindrical sheath around the other conductor. The cylindrical sheath is used as an earth conductor and at the same time shields the inner conductor from electromagnetic noise.


The Faraday cage consists of a [2,147] deep mesh cylinder with [2,148] diameter, closed at the bottom and isolated from the foot plate with a [2,149] long ceramic rod. Do not touch the ceramic stick with your fingers! Around the Faraday cage, a mesh cylinder is placed which is connected to earth to shield the Faraday cage from electromagnetic noise.

[2,187]

Strictly speaking, Coulomb's law only applies to point charges. For spheres of finite extent, the interaction between the surface charges on the spheres will give an uneven charge distribution on the sphere surfaces. For two spheres with a radius [2.188] at a distance greater than 10 cm, this will lead to a deviation of less than [2.189] in relation to values ​​calculated using Coulomb's Law [2,190]. How big an error does this lead to in the measurements?


[2,191] {Gravitational force}

We want to measure the electrostatic force between the spheres with as much accuracy as possible. In the setup, we will have a gravitational interaction between the spheres in addition to the electrostatic force. The bullets weigh about [2,192] each.

[2,317]


While measuring, the charge will gradually leak out of the spheres, especially if you spend a long time on the measuring series. Therefore, try to reduce the time as much as possible but maintain accuracy. Since the premise is that the charge on the spheres must be constant during each measuring series, the charge loss will lead to a measuring error. It is important to set up the measurement procedure so that this source of error can be checked. You can therefore take [2,318] with discharge and charging of the spheres between each series. In the first series you measure (as described) [2.319] for decreasing values ​​of [2.320] and in the next series you measure [2.321] for the same [2.322] values ​​in ascending order. Comparison of the measurements at corresponding distances between the two series will provide information on changing the charge. Another way to control charge loss is to perform a control measurement at a specific [2,323] value e.g. [2,324] between each measurement. As long as the result of the control measurement remains constant, you have not lost charge. Even if you notice that the charge is starting to leak, you can continue the measurement, as systematic errors are part of how accurate we can make these measurements.

Another measurement error is that when ball K [2,325] is displaced as a result of the repulsion, the distance between the balls is not equal to what the scale indicates. This is most important when the bullets are close, but this effect is quite small in our experiment, as it is a matter of small forces and the force sensor does not move far. Make an estimate, if possible of how far the sensor moves at full force between the balls and the small distance.

A third measurement error is due to polarization of the charge on the spheres. Equal charges repel each other so that the center-to-center distance of the charge distribution on each sphere is greater than the geometric center-to-center distance of the spheres. This error is also most significant when the bullets are close. Make an estimate of the size of the error.

What will happen if the bullets do not have the same charge?

In Experiment 1, you measured the electrostatic force [2,357] between two metal spheres. If you also measure the charge on the spheres, you can from Coulomb's law [2.358] determine the permittivity of the air [2.359] when the distance is known.

[2,376]

You may have noticed that the electrometer got the final turn even before you touched the grid? This is called induction and is due to the fact that the charge on the sensor attracts / repels the electrons in the grid so that a charge is collected on the outside of the grid that is as large as the charge we want to measure.

Use the result for an optional value of [2,377] from Experiment 1 to find the force between two fully charged, well-known spheres. The spheres K [2.378] and K [2.379] have the same dimension as the sphere K [2.380] on the charge axis, so that they are expected to receive the same charge when charged from the electron gun. Remember to halve the charge on K [2.381] before measuring in the Faraday cage.

When the charge is measured and the potential is known, you can calculate the ball's capacitance from equation [2.386]. If the radius of the sphere, [2.387], is measured, you can calculate the permittivity of the air from the expression [2.388] for the capacitance of the sphere.
