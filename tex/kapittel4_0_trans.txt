[2.17]

The theory is presented in connection with the presentation of the calculation tasks below. Reference is also made to the textbook and the lectures in electromagnetism.

[2.22] {Lorentzkraften}
[2.23]

The force from electric and magnetic fields on charged particles is often called the Lorentz force. The force of a charged particle with charge [2.24] moving at velocity [2.25] in an electrostatic field [2.26] and a magnetostatic field [2.27] is given by
[1.1]
[2.28]
To create a fast electron beam, electric fields are always used to accelerate the electrons. However, the expression for Lorentz power shows that both electric and magnetic fields give a power effect on charged particles.

{[2.29] 1. Explain from the expression of the Lorentz force why magnetic fields (as opposed to electric fields) can not give a charged particle increased kinetic energy.}

[2.30] {Charges in [2.31] field}
[2.32]

A homogeneous electric field is most easily set up between two parallel plate electrodes. This geometry provides an electric field [2.33] where [2.34] is the voltage between the plates and [2.35] the distance between them. A charged particle with charge [2.36] and mass [2.37] is accelerated with an acceleration during passage between the plates
[1.2]
[2.38]
This is used in sources of charged particle beams.

Figure [2.39] shows how an electron beam source can be made. A tungsten filament is heated by electric current passing through it. When it is red hot, it emits electrons from the surface. The filament is placed just behind a plate electrode with holes in it. Voltage is applied between the filament and the plate electrode. The electrons are accelerated towards the plate electrode and the electrons passing through the hole go out in a beam on the other side of the plate. Another way to make electrons in electron sources is to use an oxide cathode that is heated indirectly by a filament. This construction provides better field conditions during acceleration, and it is this version that is shown in figure [2.40].
[2.41]

[1.3]

Assume that an electron is accelerated from a standstill to a voltage of [2.42] in a static electric field.

{[2.43] 2. What is the speed of the electron after the acceleration? }

In particle accelerator physics, the energy unit "electron volt" is abbreviated [2.44]. A particle charge with an elementary charge gets the energy 1 eV when it is accelerated through a voltage drop of [2.45].

{[2.46] 3A. How many joules is equivalent to [2.47]? }

{[2.48] 3B. What is the energy of an electron that is accelerated to a voltage of [2.49] expressed in the unit [2.50]?}
 
An electron beam from an electron source with zero potential is accelerated to a potential [2.51] can be deflected in a transverse electric field [2.52] over a distance [2.53] as shown in figure [2.54]. The deflection angle [2.55] is given by
[1.4]

[1.5]

Equation [2.56] describes the physical laws that form the basis of the oscilloscope, which is an instrument for measuring electrical voltage. The voltage to be measured is placed between the transverse deflection plates and the deflection of the electron beam observed on a phosphorescent screen is a measure of the voltage.

[2.57]

Assume the electrons are accelerated by a [2.58] acceleration potential and the other parameters are as shown in Figure [2.59].

{[2.60] 4. How much deflection [2.61] does the beam on the screen get if the deflection voltage is [2.62]?}

[2.63] {Charges in [2.64] field}
[2.65]

When an electron moves in a space free of electric field but with a magnetic field [2.66], the Lorentz force at all times acts normally on the path of the path (unless the path is parallel to the magnetic field). Let's assume the electron is shot into the [2.67] field at velocity perpendicular to the field, the Lorentz force then becomes [2.68] and constitutes the centripetal force. The electron orbit becomes a circle of radius [2.69] with centripetal acceleration [2.70]. The speed [2.71] can be determined from the kinetic energy of the electron given by [2.72]. By putting these equations together, we get the following expression for the radius
[1.6]

{[2.73] 5. Set up in a curve diagram curve intersections over [2.74] sfa. [2.75] in the range [2.76] for [2.77], [2.78] and [2.79]}. Use, for example, Python or Matlab.


[2.80] {Determination of [2.81] (Thomson Experiment)}
[2.82]
 
In 1897, Thomson discovered
[2.83]
extremely light, negatively charged particles - which later turned out to be electrons. That same year, he used deflection in static electric and magnetic fields to find the relationship between their charge and mass. The expression [2.84] can be rewritten to
[1.7]
[2.85]
The ratio [2.86] can thus be determined by measuring the radius [2.87] in the electron path in a magnetic field [2.88] perpendicular to the path of electrons accelerated above a voltage [2.89].

You will repeat Thomson's experiment in the laboratory. The size of the equipment limits the diameter of the largest electron orbit to approx. [2.90].

{[2.91] 6. Use the curve cutter that you set up in the problem above to estimate the favorable magnetic field [2.92] for three different acceleration voltages [2.93], [2.94] and [2.95].}
 
When rewriting [2.96] you get
[1.8]
[2.97]
showing that the mass [2.98] of a charged particle with a known charge [2.99] that has been accelerated to a known potential [2.100] can be determined by measuring the magnetic flux density [2.101] and the orbital radius [2.102] of the particle in a magnetic field. This is the idea behind the magnetostatic mass spectrometer which is one of the most important instruments for determining atomic and molecular particle masses. With his work, Thomson laid the foundation for this technique.

[2.103] {Voltage components [2.104]}
[2,105]
 
The so-called voltage divider is among the most common electrical connections. You must use it in the experiment. In its simplest form, the voltage divider looks like in figure [2.106] A.

[1.9]
[2,107]

[2,108]
Through the coupling, the voltage [2.109] can be reduced to [2.110]. To find the size of [2,111] sfa. [2.112] you can look at the current [2.113] through the resistors [2.114] and [2.115] which according to Ohm's law are equal
[1.10]
Use Ohm's law again on [2,116]:
[1.11]
The voltage divider can be made variable by replacing [2.117] and [2.118] with a resistor with variable center tap (sliding resistance) as shown in figure [2.119] B. Together with a fixed voltage source, this provides an opportunity to create a cheap variable voltage source.

However, the voltage divider has a disadvantage.

{[2.120] 7. Can you find what disadvantage? }
Catalog [2,121] [2,122]
TIP: What happens to [2.123] when you start drawing power from the output (center tapping)? See Figure [2,124] C. The resultant resistance across the parallel connection of [2.125] and [2.126] is denoted [2.127] and is equal to [2.128].

The apparatus is shown schematically in Figures [2,159] and [2,160]. The electron gun ([2.161]) emits electrons that can be deflected in a static electric field between the parallel deflection plates ([2.162]) and / or in a static magnetic field from the Helmholtz coils. The glass flask around the electron gun is filled with thin hydrogen gas to a pressure of approximately [2,163] atmospheres [2,164]. Shock between the electrons and the gas will excite the electrons in the gas molecules which then dexcite and emit light (same phenomenon as in the northern lights). The trace of the electrons then becomes visible as a blue-green stripe.

{[2.165] Study the electron gun through the glass flask. Also study the disassembled cannon from an old pipe laid out in the laboratory.}

Figures [2.169] and [2.170] show schematically the electrical connections for the electron gun. Note the common ground point (output 2 on Leybold Power supply)

[1.13]

[1.14]

There are several alternative ways to connect the electron gun, but it is important to connect directly. However, it is not difficult to break a couple of fuses if you connect incorrectly, so ask the supervisor if you are in doubt.

{[2.171] Connect the glow circuit according to figure [2.172].}

Notes and tips:
[2,173]
[2,174]
    [2.175] You must connect socket 4 to the unit. Which one you use is irrelevant but one is grounded via contacts b and c [2.176] in figure [2.177].
    [2.178] The unit must be switched off during connection.
    [2.179] Ask the lab supervisor to approve the connection.
    [2.180] Switch on the unit and adjust the glow voltage to "6" (V) and observe that the wire glows. This assumes that the ceiling lighting is switched off and the table lighting is dimmed. Note that the glow voltage can be lowered to 5 V during the experiments.
    [2.181] Switch off the unit again.

To extract an electron beam from the cathode, the electrons must be accelerated as explained above in the theory section. This is done by applying an acceleration voltage between the cathode and the anode.

{[2.201] Connect the acceleration voltage according to figure [2.202]}. [2.203]

Notes and tips:
[2,204]
[2,205]
    [2.206] Make sure that the power supply is switched off and that the power and voltage adjustment knobs are turned all the way down when connecting.
    [2.207] Connect Leybold output 3 to "a" and output 2 to "b".
    [2.208] Preliminary deflection potential [2.209], therefore the two deflection plates (e [2.210] and e [2.211]) are connected together and possibly grounded or connected to the anode, to prevent charge from building up on them.
    [2.212] To avoid measurement errors due to voltage drop across the series resistor, you can connect the voltmeter directly to the anode instead of "f". Use measuring range 1000 V DC. Check the value of the Leybold unit. How big a measurement error do you get and what determines the size of the error?
    [2.213] The series resistors mounted internally in the equipment are inserted for safety reasons to avoid excessive current in the circuit in the event of an internal short circuit (eg [2.214] a gas discharge).

[2.230] Increase the acceleration voltage slowly until you (at 20--30 V or slightly higher if your eyes have not waited until dark) see
the trace of the electron beam in the hydrogen gas as a blue-violet stripe out of the electron gun.
[2.231] Observe how the beam changes when you change the acceleration voltage.
[2.232] Why does the beam not reach the glass wall at low acceleration? At higher voltages, quite abruptly, the beam will meet the wall, then lower the voltage slightly. This happens at different voltages at the different setups, follow closely with around 100 V, and possibly upwards to approx. 150 V.
[2.233] NOTE: If the anode starts to glow, turn off the appliance and let it cool down. Never use higher acceleration voltages than necessary to avoid glowing.
[2,234]
[2,235]


Procedure for [2,236]:
[2,237]
[2,238]
[2.239] Switch off the glow plug.
[2.240] Reduce the acceleration voltage to zero and switch off the power supply.
[2,241]
[2,242]
NOTE: It is not dangerous to have on acceleration voltage and magnetic field without having on glow voltage, but it is not good to have on glow voltage without acceleration voltage. Therefore, always switch off the glow voltage when you have short and long breaks.

In an electron beam, all the particles have the same sign of charge. The beam will therefore have a tendency to diverge due to internal Coulomb power. If the focusing ring (Wehnelt cylinder) in front of the cathode is placed slightly negative, this will have a focusing effect on the beam.

{[2.243] Connect the Wehnelt cylinder according to figure [2.244].}
Output 1 to "W".
Notes and tips:
[2,245]
[2,246]
    [2.247] Check that the power supply is switched off and that the power and voltage adjustment knobs are turned down completely before connecting it.
    [2.248] After connecting the Wehnelt cylinder and switching on the power supply. Adjust the voltage on the focusing electrode (Wehnelt cylinder) if you think the beam is poorly focused. Use maximum [2,249].

[2,251]

[2.252] {Deflection in [2.253] field}
[2,254]

Task: [2,255] [2,256]

In the setup so far, you have laid both deflection plates at the same voltage, namely the anode voltage [2.257]. To obtain deflection, one plate is placed on a somewhat lower voltage. In practice, we do this by taking voltage division from the anode voltage. The principle of voltage division is shown in Figure [2.258]. Here you have to make changes to the connection. The anode voltage (3) should now be connected with a junction box according to the diagram in figure [2.259] shows changes you must make from the connection in figure [2.260] where the deflection potential was zero. The connection between e [2.261] and e [2.262] is removed.


The voltage divider consists of a precision potentiometer (Helipot) and is mounted on junction box B. The acceleration voltage [2,263] is connected across the potentiometer. From the center tapping, we take out a voltage that varies with the position of the potentiometer button, which needs 10 revolutions to turn from top to bottom. The deflection voltage is taken out between the top outlet (which is at potential [2.264]) and the middle outlet at potential [2.265], where [2.266] can vary from 0 to [2.267]. This means that one deflection plate is at the anode voltage [2.268] and the other at [2.269]. The deflection stress then becomes
[1.15]
If you connect incorrectly and take out voltage division to the ground potential, the electron beam will be braked sharply and easily disappear. You can find out which record should have lower potential by thinking, or by trial and error.

{[2.270] Connect the deflection potential according to figure [2.271].}
 
[1.16]

Notes and tips:
[2,272]
[2,273]
    [2.274] Set the potentiometer to [2.275] so that the center tap has the same potential as the anode voltage.
    [2.276] Switch on glow, focusing voltage and acceleration as described previously.
    [2.277] Vary the deflection by turning the potentiometer knob.

The result is given in a calibration curve attached to the apparatus and as an empirical expression of the magnetic field as a function of the measured coil current found from the calibration curve.
