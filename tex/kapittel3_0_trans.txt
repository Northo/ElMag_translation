[2.14]
[2.15] {Theoretical background}
[2.16]

Biot-Savart's law is presented here. Some theory is presented in the text for the calculation tasks in section [2.17]. Otherwise, reference is made to the textbook and the lectures in electromagnetism.

[2.18] {Biot-Savarts Law}

Electric fields are generated around any electric charge while magnetic fields are generated around electric charges that move. In 1820, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart performed magnetic field experiments on live conductors and set up the following expression for the magnetic field contribution [2.19] at a point P in space from the current [2.20] in a wire element [2.21],
[1.1]
where [2.22] is the position vector of the point P measured from the current element [2.23], [2.24] is the unit vector along [2.25] and [2.26] is the magnetic permeability in empty space. Note the [2.27] dependence, the same as for the electric field strength in Coulomb's law. The superposition principle applies to magnetic fields, and consequently the total field strength [2.28] at point P from the whole conductor can be found by integrating the whole over the length of the conductor [2.29]:
[1.2]
[2.30]
In the experiment, you will examine the magnetic field along the axis of circular coils. The simplest circular spool you can make consists of a simple wire loop as shown in Figure [2.31].
[2.32]
[1.3]

The magnetic field on the axis of the sling will have a component in the axis direction [2.33] and a component normally on this. According to Biot-Savart's law, the normal component will be zeroed out by contributions (integration) over the entire loop, as the symmetry of the system gives equal strength in all directions. For the [2.34] component we get by inserting [2.35] and using [2.36],
[2.37]
[1.4]
where [2.38] is the integration angle around the loop circle. Integrated over the loop with [2.39] gives this result
[2.40]
[1.5]
For [2.41] (middle of the loop) becomes [2.42] and for [2.43] (far away from the loop) becomes [2.44].


[2.45]
[2.46] {Calculation tasks [2.47]}
[2.48]

[2.49]
[2.50] {Calculation and documentation [2.51]}
[2.52]

To perform calculations and to create tables / diagrams, you can freely choose between suitable programs (for example Python, Matlab, Origin, Excel or similar). Data and results must be documented in the lab journal (for example by pasting printouts of the tables and diagrams in the lab journal or by entering results). The program code and the original files used for calculation must be available in case of questions. The program code can be pasted into the lab journal.

[2.53] {Short Coil}

The magnetic field from a short coil with [2.54] windings can be seen far from the coil (in relation to the extent of the coil) as the sum of the magnetic field from [2.55] current loops given in equation [2.56]. The magnetic field on the axis at a distance [2.57] from the middle center of the coil is then according to equation [2.58] given by
[2.59]
[1.6]
[2.60]
where [2.61] is the average radius of the current loops.

Assume that you have a short coil with [2.62] and an average radius [2.63] with a constant current [2.64] through the windings.

{[2.65] 1A. Make a table of the magnetic flux density [2.66] on the axis of the coil in the area [2.67].}

A suggested table is shown in Figure [2.68].
Constants are entered in rows under the heading. This is followed by table values ​​where each column must have a descriptive text.

[2.73]

{[2.74] 1B. Present the result in a graph.}

{[2.75] Discuss the calculation of the magnetic field of a short coil when the extent of the coil is taken into account.}

The program or spreadsheet in Excel can also be used to calculate expected magnetic field strengths as a result of Biot-Savart's [2.76] law and subsequent comparison with experimentally measured magnetic field strengths in section [2.77].

{[2.78] 1C. Include a column for measured value of [2.79] and a column for deviation between measured and calculated value given in [2.80], and also prepare to show the deviation graphically.} (A suggestion is given in the table in figure [2.81].)

Take a control bill by hand from one of the calculated [2.82]. Check the calculated difference by entering the hand-calculated value.

[2.83]

[2.84]

The actual spool you are going to use in the problem has 22 windings in 15 layers with an effective wire diameter equal to [2.85], wound with inner diameter equal to [2.86] and outer diameter equal to [2.87].

{[2.88] 2. How do you think the real magnetic field near the coil will differ from the magnetic field calculated from equation [2.89]?}
[2.90] {TIP: Look at the extent of the coil as an error in [2.91] and estimate the corresponding error [2.92] in [2.93].}

{[2.94] 3. If you were to take into account the extent of the coil during the calculations of the field, how would you proceed?} [2.95] {TIP: Divide the coil into e.g. three coils with 110 windings each and calculate the field from each of the coils and superimpose the effect. The best thing you can do is treat each winding separately, and in practice, that means integration over each winding.}

[2.96] {Helmholtzspoler}
[2.97]

So-called Helmholtz coils
[2.98]
consists of two identical, short series-connected coils set up parallel on the same axis at a distance [2.99] as shown in figure [2.100]. The axial magnetic field on the axis is given by equation [2.101] for each coil. According to the superposition principle, we find the total field at a distance [2,102] from the center plane between the coils to be equal
[2,103]
[1.8]
[2,104]
Here the average radius of the coils is equal to [2.105], the current through the coils is equal to [2.106] and we have neglected the extent of the coils.

If you derive equation [2.107] with respect to [2.108] you will find that at [2.109] [2.110] is when [2.111]. This means that when [2.112] you have a geometry that gives you a particularly good homogeneous magnetic field in the area between the coils. Such Helmholtz coils are used to set up homogeneous magnetic fields in many situations.

[1.9]
Suppose you have Helmholtz coils with [2,113] on each coil, [2.114] and send a constant current [2.115] through the windings.

{[2,116] 4A. Make a table of the magnetic flux density [2.117] on the axis of the Helmholtz coil in the range [2.118] for each of the three different values ​​[2.119] and [2.120].}

A suggested table is shown in Figure [2.121].

[1.10]

{[2,122] 4B. Present the result in a curve diagram}

The spreadsheet shall also be used for the calculation of expected magnetic field strengths as a result of Biot-Savart's law [2.123] and subsequent comparison with experimentally measured magnetic field strengths in section [2.124].

{[2,125] 4C. Include a column for measured value of [2,126] and a column for deviations between measured and calculated value given in [2,127] for [2,128]. Repeat this for the other two values ​​of [2.129]. Prepare to display the deviation graphically.} (A suggestion is given in the table in figure [2.130].)

Take a control bill by hand from one of the calculated [2.131]. Check the calculated difference by inserting some imaginary measured values.

[2,132] {Anti-Helmholtz Coil}
[2,133]

Anti-Helmholtz coils consist of two identical, short series-connected coils set up parallel on the same axis at a distance [2.134] as shown in figure [2.135], with different directions on the magnetic field. How do you find the field in this configuration?

[1.11]

{[2,136] 5A. Make a table of the magnetic flux density [2.137] on the axis of the Anti-Helmholtz coil in the area [2.138] for each of the three different distances [2.139] and [2.140].}

{[2,141] 5B. Present the result in a graph.}

The spreadsheet shall also be used for the calculation of expected magnetic field strengths as a result of Biot-Savart's law [2.142] and subsequent comparison with experimentally measured magnetic field strengths in section [2.143].

{[2,144] 5C. Include a column for measured values ​​of [2,145] and a column for discrepancies between measured and calculated values ​​given in [2,146] for [2,147]. Repeat this for the other two values ​​of [2.148]. Prepare the spreadsheet to display the deviation graphically.} (A suggestion is given in the table in Figure [2.149].)

Make a control calculation by hand of one of the calculated [2,150]. Check the calculated difference by entering the hand-calculated value.

[2,151] {Solenoid [2,152]}
[2,153]

The magnetic field at a point P on the axis of a solenoid can be found from Biot-Savart's law, and the result is
[1.12]
where [2.154] is the length of the solenoid and the angles [2.155] and [2.156] are defined in Figure [2.157] or analytically:
[1.13]
where [2.158] = inner radius of the solenoid and [2.159] is the axis distance from the left end of the solenoid to the point. Inside the solenoid are [2,160] and [2,161]. The formula also applies outside the solenoid.
[2,162]
[1.14]

[2.163]:} In equation [2.164] we have found magnetic fields on the axis at a distance [2.165] from a single loop. In a solenoid we have many loops close together, we define current per unit length as [2,166], where [2,167] is the number of windings per length. Flux density at a point P on the axis then receives a contribution from the thin current loop [2.168] in position [2.169], and according to the first part of equation [2.170] the flux density is equal
[1.15]
[2,171]
With [2.172] as the angle at point P between the solenoid axis and the periphery at position [2.173] (figure [2.174]) we see that [2.175], and derivation of [2.176] gives
[1.16]
[2,177]
We notice that
[1.17]
so that
[1.18]
and by substituting [2.178] in equation [2.179] and inserting boundaries [2.180] (right end, lowest [2.181]) to [2.182] (left end, highest [2.183]), we will get
[2,184]
[1.19]
to be displayed.

{[2.186] 5. What is the expression of the magnetic field deep inside the solenoid, and what is it at the end of the solenoid?}
Catalog [2,187] [2,188]
TIP: What are [2,189] and [2,190] at these positions?

Suppose you have a solenoid with [2,191], [2,192], [2,193] and current [2,194].

{[2,195] 6A. Make a table of the magnetic flux density [2.196] on the axis of the solenoid in the area [2.197] where [2.198] at the left edge of the solenoid.} [2.199]

[2,202]

A suggested table is shown in Figure [2,203].
[2,204]
[1.20]

{[2,205] 6B. Present the result in a curve diagram}

The spreadsheet shall also be used for the calculation of expected magnetic field strengths as a result of Biot-Savart's law [2.206] and subsequent comparison with experimentally measured magnetic field strengths in section [2.207].

{[2,208] 6C. Include a column for measured value of [2,209] and a column for deviations between measured and calculated value given in [2,210]}. (A suggestion is given in the table in Figure [2.211].)

[2,212] {Python Data Analysis}
The previous tasks can be done in Python, for example. It is advisable to save the data in text files. Here we use comma separated files as shown below.

[1.21]

Here, the first column represents [2.213], and the second column represents [2.214] in Figure [2.215]. The remaining columns can be calculated in Python. To read the data, we create the following code:

[2,216] [bgcolor = bg] {python}
# - * - coding: utf-8 - * -
import numpy as np


def main ():
    filename = 'short_spool.csv'
    data = np.loadtxt (filename, delimiter = ',')
    xe = data [:, 0]
    Be = data [:, 1]

if (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main ()
[2,217]

In the [2.218] function, the text file [2.219] is read. The position data, located in the first column, is stored in the variable [2.220] and the data for the measured magnetic field is stored in the variable [2.221].

The next thing we need to do is implement a function that calculates the magnetic field according to equation [2.222]. We can do this as follows:

[2,223] [bgcolor = bg] {python}
def B_field_short_coil (x):
    prefactor = N * mu_0 * I0 / (2 * R)
    return prefactor * (1.0 + (x / R) ** 2) ** (- 1.5)
[2,224]

To plot the result for the calculated field, we add some lines in the [2.225] function. We also need to define some parameters used in the calculation. The whole program then looks like this:

[2,226] [bgcolor = bg] {python}
# - * - coding: utf-8 - * -
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


N = 330 # [] number of windings
I0 = 1.0 # [A] current
mu_0 = 4.0 * np.pi * 1e-7 # [H / m] permeability in empty space
R = 0.07 # [m] radius
x0 = 0.400 # [m] center of coil

def B_field_short_coil (x):
    prefactor = N * mu_0 * I0 / (2 * R)
    return prefactor * (1.0 + (x / R) ** 2) ** (- 1.5)
    
def main ():
    filename = 'short_spool.csv'
    data = np.loadtxt (filename, delimiter = ',')
    xe = data [:, 0] - x0 # position, centered around x0
    Be = data [:, 1] # measurement data
    
    # Calculate the B field
    xb = np.linspace (xe [0], xe [-1], 100) # multiple data points
    Bb = B_field_short_coil (xb) * 1e4 # calculated B-field (Gauss)
    
    # Plot the results
    plt.plot (xb, Bb, label = 'Calculated')
    plt.plot (xe, Be, '.', label = 'Measurement data')
    plt.xlabel ('Distance from center of coil (m)')
    plt.ylabel ('Magnetic field (Gaussian)')
    plt.legend ()
    plt.show ()
    
if (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main ()
[2,227]

You can now create more functions to plot the results for a Helmholtz coil and a solenoid. Remember that it often pays to divide the program into smaller functions. This makes the code easier to read, but also allows you to reuse much of the code for other purposes. More examples of plotting can be found here: [2.228].

[2,229] {Hall effect probe}
[2,230]

When electrons move at speed [2.231] in a semiconductor located in a magnetic field [2.232] as shown in Figure [2.233], the electrons will bend to one side. The deflection is given by the Lorentz force [2.234], where [2.235] for electrons.

[1.22]

[2,236]
[2,237]
[2,238]
[2,239]
[2,240]
[2,241]
[2,242]
[2,243]

The Lorentz force acts normally on the current direction and normally on [2.244] and the deflection due to this causes the electron concentration to become stronger against one wall of the semiconductor. An electric field [2,245] thus builds up in the conductor with the same direction as the Lorentz force, and this field gives an additional force [2,246] on the electrons. An equilibrium will quickly arise where electrostatic force and Lorentz force are equal so that
[1.23]

The speed [2,247] of the electrons through the semiconductor is determined by the current at the expression [2,248], where [2,249] is the density of electrons and [2,250] is the cross section in the conductor direction. This gives
[1.24]
where we have defined the Hall constant [2,251].

With [2,252] equal to the width of the probe, the voltage [2,253] will form across the side walls. If we disregard the sign and use that [2.254] we get the following expression for Hallspenningen [2.255]:

[1.25]

where [2,256] is the thickness of the Hall probe that the magnetic field [2,257] acts over. The hall constants [2.258] and [2.259] are constants for a given probe and the current [2.260] is kept constant. The magnetic flux density [2.261] normally on the probe will then be proportional to the Hall voltage [2.262] which is measured with a voltmeter.

[2,263]
[1.26]

[2,264]

The hall effect is used i.a. in Gaussian meters for measuring magnetic fields. A Hall Power Gaussmeter will essentially consist of a current source that provides a constant current [2,265] through a probe, and a voltmeter. The probe is placed in the magnetic field to be measured. Through a calibration process, the relationship between the measured Hall voltage and the magnetic field can be established and the voltage reading unit is graded directly in [2.266] or [2.267].

In practice, the extent of a Hallprobe is of the order of a few [2,268]. Two different probe geometries are common: transverse probes and axial probes, as shown in Figure [2,269].

Typical value for the electron density in a doped semiconductor is [2,270]. By comparison, copper has [2,271]. In our Gaussian meters are [2,272] and [2,273]. Assume that the magnetic field varies from 1 to [2,274].

{[2,275] 7A. What measuring range must the Gaussmeter voltmeter have to measure in this magnetic field range? (Assume at [2,276].)

7B. Why do you think semiconductors are used in magnetic field probes? Explain why e.g. copper will not be a suitable material.
 
7C. Also explain why an insulator will not be a suitable material in a magnetic field probe.
}

[2,277] {Magnetic scattering fields}

In the laboratory, the magnetic scattering field forms a background that can interfere with magnetic field measurements. The spreading fields have three main sources:
[2,278]
[2,279]
    [2,280] the earth magnetic field,
    [2,281] magnetic fields from magnetic materials in building structures and fixtures,
    [2,282] induced magnetic fields from i.a. [2,283] power cords.
[2,284]

The earth's magnetic field, which is constant and of the order of magnitude [2,285], is believed to originate from convection currents of electric charges in the earth's liquid core. Assume that in the middle of the earth's interior there is a current loop perpendicular to the earth's axis of rotation. Let the radius of the current phase be [2.286], where [2.287] is the radius of the earth. The axial component of the magnetic field in position [2.288] on the axis of such a current loop is given by equation [2.289].

{[2,290] 8. How large must the current in the loop be for the magnetic field on the earth's surface at the pole ([2,291]) to be equal to [2,292]? }

[2,293]

Contributions to the current magnetic field from the building and the inventory will depend on the building and construction materials used. You will evaluate the contributions to this in the laboratory through your own measurements.

Contribution to the spreading field from the currents in non-shielded wires can be estimated by calculating the field set up by a long straight conductor leading the current [2,294]. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field at a distance [2,295] from a long conductor can be found from [2,296] {Derivation e.g. i [2.297], Kap. 23.5.} Biot-Savarts Law [2,298]
[1.27]

{[2.299] 9. How large is the magnetic flux density at a distance [2,300] from a long [2,301] mains lead due to a current [2,302] in this wire?}

[2,303] {Magnetic field-free room [2,304]}
[2,305]

The permanent magnetic field on the earth's surface leads to problems with zeroing of Gaussian meters. However, magnetic fields can be shielded by using materials with high permeability. Pure iron can be used. There are also special alloys that have even higher permeability [2,306] and thus shields even better. An example is mymetal [2,307] {Mymetal is an alloy of [2,308] nickel, [2,309] iron plus some copper and molybdenum. It got its name due to very high value for magnetic permeability, [2.310].}. Gauss meters are usually zeroed by inserting the Gauss meter probe into a chamber that shields it from the ground magnetic field during zeroing.

    This is a combined power-controlled / voltage-controlled power supply. That is, [2,376] it can supply a constant current or a constant voltage, up to a certain maximum load. The box has two adjustment buttons, one for voltage marked "[2.377]" and one for current marked "[2.378]".
    [2,379]
    [2,380] we have if the voltage adjustment is set to maximum. The current is regulated with the current adjustment knob.
    [2,381]
    [2,382] we have if the power adjustment is set to maximum. The voltage is regulated with the voltage adjustment knob.
    [2,383]
    If the box is used current-controlled, the maximum current [2.384] can be given to an equivalent output resistance of maximum [2.385]. The box also has a button marked "range" which can limit the maximum voltage to [2,386] instead of standard [2,387]. If [2.388] is selected, the maximum output resistance will be [2.389]. At higher output resistance, the output voltage will be kept at maximum value and the current will be lower.
    [2,390]
    Corresponding maximum regulation is for voltage-controlled power supply. [2.391] maximum voltage can be given down to a resistance of [2.392]. At lower resistance, the supply will not be able to provide enough current so that the voltage will drop.
[2,393]

[2,394] {Calibration of Hallprobe}
[2,395]

It is difficult to produce Hall probes with exactly the same Hall constants. The hall voltage that occurs at a given magnetic field and current may therefore vary slightly from probe to probe. In order to be able to use several probes for the same Gaussmeter, each probe has often assigned a calibration number which is used to adjust the gain of the Gaussmeter's voltmeter so that the meter shows the correct magnetic field. PASCO's sensors are adjusted and a calibration is not normally needed. Before use, the sensor must be reset.

[2.428] {Statistical error in measurements}
[2,429]

Reading magnetic field strengths from Hallproben will give a somewhat varying result. You can use this to find the statistical error.

Task: [2.430] [2.431]
[2,432]
[2,433]
    [2.434] Connect the sensors in the PASCO interface and the computer interface. Start Capstone and get ready for data sampling.
    [2.435] Reset and sample data in [2.436]. Select data and perform a statistical analysis with built-in functionality in Capstone. What will be the standard deviation of the data? What standard deviations do you get if you sample in [2.437] and [2.438]? How many samples should you use?
    [2.439] Use the standard deviation as an error in your data from Hallproben.

[2,441] {Magnetic field in short coil}
[2,442]

Task: [2,443] [2,444]
 
[2,445]

To measure the magnetic field, you can either hold the coil and move the Hallproben or you can attach the Hallproben and move the coil.
Which of these is best to use? Motivate!
